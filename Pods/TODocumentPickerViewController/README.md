The goal of this project is to provide an interface for interacting with file systems, whether on remote devices through an API (e.g, Dropbox), or locally on the device itself. To that end, the view controller has been designed to accept a separate data source object, responsible for managing the file system information, allowing interaction with any type of file system service.

While functional, TODocumentPickerViewController is still heavily in development and not in use by any production apps yet. Discretion is advised, and feel free to submit pull requests!
